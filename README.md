# ComputerVisionImageProcessing
Computer Vision Image manupulation techniques:
- Image Noising (Gaussian, Salt pepper etc.)
- Algebraic Image Operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
- Logarithmic Image Processing (LIP)
- SVM model trainning
- Segmentation
- Edge Detection
- Color spaces (HSV, RGB, Luv, Lab, YIQ, YUV)
-  Applying a class of mean (Arithmetic, weighted mean, Geometric, mean filter)
- Local noise reduction, image restoration filter
- Image enhancement
- Contrast stretching  algorithm
- Gamma correction
- Niblack's and Sauvola's thresholding algorithms
